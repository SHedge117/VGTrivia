## Introduction
This was the last project of my iOS Development Class. This app allows users to test their video game knowledge by answering a variety of questions ranging in difficulty.

## Question List
Upon opening the app the user will have a list of questions to answer. These questions are fetched from a trivia API and organized in the app. This list view will also show the difficulty of that question which is determined by the API. If the user wanted, they could pick out questions of an easier or harder difficulty

## Question Screen
When you tap on a question it will display the question number along with the question and possible answers. Each question is multiple choice and contains 4 answers where 1 is correct. When the user taps on an answer the border will change to red or green depending on if it was the right one or not. If the user exits and comes back the answer will still be revealed. The API questions are random so everytime the app is booted up there will be different questions.
